# terraform-aws-asg

This module can be used to create an AWS auto-scaling group uing Terraform. It includes Centos AMI image and an attached ELB to load your trafffic properly. Security groups are added, allowing port 22. By default ASG min size is 1 instance (you can also set the type of instance you want to create with autoscaling) and max size is 1 instance as well. 


Good luck!
